### Updates

#### ðŸ”­ October 2023 - Till now. 
- Mostly active in the Atlassian ecosystem for now; Bitbucket, Jira, Confluence.
- Sideprojects on Github.
  
#### September 2015 -  September 2021
- ðŸ“Œ Contributions 2015-2021 not visible anymore due to leaving a organisation. If you dip out of the organisation without starring the repos you've been grinding on, those commits won't show up on your contribution chart. It's like they never happened. So hit that star before you split to keep your GitHub street cred intact! My 6 years of contributions from 2015 to 2021 are not visible because of that!
